    <div class="moment">
      <h3>2. Hadoop Instalation ☕🙈</h3>
      <p>The time when we had a complete conversation with each other. It was like a stage one of knowing Rabiya. At first she use used to talk by saying "Aap" this much respect, but didn't knew ki yeh sirf kuch dino ki baat hai, Chudail abhi jagi nhi thi😬</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Moment 3 -->
    <div class="moment">
      <h3>3. My Birthday 😆</h3>
      <p>It was my birthday and Nidhin,Anamika and Sumit planned to cut the cake. When I met Nidhin, He asked me if you want to call someone else then you can call now & the name came to my mind was yours , but I was doubtfull whether you will come or not because it was just the begining of our friendship , after thinking alot I called you and boom you said yess
        , Now I was happy but my happiness increased when you gifted me that braclet, as I don't expects gifts from anyone and no one has gifted me also accept my mother and my close relatives, and a gift from your side was not even I thought of as it was just 3-4 days we started talking. So this is one of the moment which is very special for me😶</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Moment 4 -->
    <div class="moment">
      <h3>4. Ramadan Eidi 🎁</h3>
      <p>It just came in my mind from nowhere that I should gift something to you in this Eid.And the night before when I was preparing the gift the only thing in my mind was the smiling face of you after seeing the gift that was the only thing I was expecting in return of this gift that's why I told you to make a video of opening the gift, the only regret is
        that the butterflies dign't go as planned , but still your reaction was amazing , I felt like the hard work I did was not waste and that moment was so awsome , I still use to see that video because it's amazing😁</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Moment 5 -->
    <div class="moment">
      <h3>5. Meeting your mother👀</h3>
      <p>Meeting friends parents is normal for me, but for meeting your mother I was really excited and was scared also like what will I talk and and what if I said something wrong what aunty will think about me etc but as I spoked to aunty all my anxiety gone down , aunty is very chill and very caring, I loved the way she blessed me and the way she talks, and
        the way she asked about my mother and the gift everything was lovely and perfect.Amazing moment to be honest👌 </p>
